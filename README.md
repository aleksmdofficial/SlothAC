## What Sloth is

Sloth is an open-source anti-cheat plugin for Minecraft servers.

## Important before you install

Sloth's AI check uses the official Sloth API. Access is arranged in the [Discord server](https://dsc.gg/kaelus).

To connect a server to the API, run `/sloth connect` and authorize it in the [Sloth panel](https://panel.kaelus.dev).

If API access is not available yet, disable the AI check for now.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or newer to run the plugin
- JDK 21 or newer if you want to build from source
- A Paper or Folia-based server
- A configured AI inference API if the AI check is enabled

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/KaelusAI/SlothAC/releases).
2. Place the main `SlothAC-<version>.jar` in the server `plugins/` directory.
3. Start the server once so Sloth can generate its configuration files.
4. Run `/sloth connect` and authorize the server in the panel.
5. If needed, configure storage:
   - SQLite is the default
   - MySQL and MariaDB are also supported
6. If WorldGuard is installed, specific regions can be excluded from the AI check.
7. Restart the server or reload the Sloth configuration.

## Configuration files

- [`config.yml`](src/main/resources/config.yml): AI, database, Redis and cross-server alerts, alerts, duplicate packet handling
- [`monitor.yml`](src/main/resources/monitor.yml): formatting for `/sloth monitor` and `/sloth view`
- [`punishments.yml`](src/main/resources/punishments.yml): punishment rules
- [`messages/messages_en.yml`](src/main/resources/messages/messages_en.yml): English messages
- [`messages/messages_ru.yml`](src/main/resources/messages/messages_ru.yml): Russian messages

## Main commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/sloth connect` | Link this server to the panel |
| `/sloth connect status` | Show the panel connection status |
| `/sloth disconnect` | Unlink this server from the panel |
| `/sloth alerts` | Toggle violation alerts |
| `/sloth suspicious <list\|top\|flagged>` | Review suspicious or previously flagged online players |
| `/sloth profile <player>` | Open a player's live profile |
| `/sloth monitor <player>` | Watch AI data for one player in real time |

| `/sloth stats` | View server-side anti-cheat stats |
| `/sloth dc <start\|stop\|cancel\|status>` | Manage labeled data collection sessions |

For the full command list, use `/sloth help` in game.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaelusAI/SlothAC.git
cd SlothAC
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The main plugin jar will be written to:

```text
build/libs/SlothAC-<version>.jar
```

## Help, bugs, and discussion

- Bug reports: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KaelusAI/SlothAC/issues)
- Community / support: [Discord](https://dsc.gg/kaelus)

Issue reports should include:

- server version
- Java version
- plugin version
- relevant config values
- logs, stack traces, and steps to reproduce

That makes problems easier to reproduce and fix.

## Credits

Sloth has its own, independently developed codebase.
